# Recalibrating_Queens

This project aims to recalibrate time and history in Western Queens towards three related ends:

  1.  To call into question the cityâ€™s development intentions for the area,
  2.   To situate and rationalize the perspectives and experiences of long-time residents-now-organizers
  3.  To support alternative future re-imaginings of the future of Western Queens
