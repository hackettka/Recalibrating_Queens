      <p>This site is currently under construction. It is being created as part of dissertation work by <a href="https://kristenhackett.info">Kristen Hackett</a>, a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://enviropsych.org">environmental psychology program</a> at <a href="https://gc.cuny.edu">Graduate Center</a>. An initial iteration of the project will be presented at the <a href="https://mappinginjustice.org/">Mapping (In)Justice Symposium</a> at Fordham University, Nov 7-9, 2019.</p>
      <h2> Insights </h2>
      <div class=blog>
        <h3>On the Matter of Frustration & Confidence</h3>
        <p> Frustration is common. It can breed self-doubt. These are COMMON to digital projects. Self-affirmations, deep breaths, and a belief in your ability to problem solve can help. Confidence will build through the process of the project, through the completion of multiple projects, etc. Though frustration will always be a reality, you gain a comfortability with this response and develop coping mechanisms that help you circumnavigate and persist. Knowing this at the start of your project can help you stick with it.</p>

        <h3>Data Gaps</h3>
        <p>This will be a critical assessment of what data was available and included, and what was not and thus not included. It is important to understand the limits of publicly-accessible data and what this allows us to reflect on and discuss and why it matters. And moreover, why its important to extend these data sources.</p>

      <div class=blog><h3> Absences </h3>
        <p> This blog post will focus on the decision to include Native groups in the race/ethnicity, even though the map largely looks blank. It will look back to the establishment of modern NYC in the 1600s, when the Dutch established a settlement here, and after 20 years of fighting with the local nation, the Lenape, purchased the island for $24. It will talk about the erasure that happened through the construction of the built environment, how renmaing things after wealthy Dutch and English landowners or concepts resituated avenues like Broadway or regions like Canarsie, which held geographic significance for Native populations as well. This history is important for understanding the social and material construction and impermanence of the world that seems to permanent... and towards the goal of opening up a discussion about rethinking property/land relations. </p>
